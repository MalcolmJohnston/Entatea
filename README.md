# testadal

testadal provides a simple data context (or data access layer) for CRUD database operations.

testadal aims to reduce the amount of test stubs and complex mocks that are required when unit testing data access, and hence to boost developer productivity *yay*

testadal is not intended to be THE solution for every database interaction, if you need something more complex or need to tune performance then you will likely still be better off writing your own repositories for those scenarios.

For everything else there is testadal.
