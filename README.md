# td-db
A data context implementation with a focus on testability.

td-db is focused on saving your writing basic CRUD functionality in both production and test scenarios.

td-db is not intended to be THE solution for every database interaction, if you need something more complex (for example JOINs) then you will be better off writing your own repository implementation.
